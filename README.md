# Count and Compare Words Program

## Overview
This Python program developed is used to facilitate the easier counting and comparison of the number of words inputted by the user. The expression applied to the words situated within the quotation marks ("), considers ‘the phrase’ as one unit, 
unlike individual words. As a result, this aspect makes it very helpful for counting as well as managing names or phrases that contain spaces, for example, those that are widely found in cities.

On top of that, there is a function that gives the opportunity to compare the original set of words given by the user with the subsequent ones. The participants will be involved as the first strings of the given texts will be compared with other 
sentences to find common elements.

## To Note
All content given either single or double words meant to be counted as one, must be between double quotes ("), the way the program gives the number of double quotes and then divides it by 2, the result will be the number of total words/phrases, the
number of quotes must be even, or it will lead to an error.
